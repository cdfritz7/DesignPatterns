Facade Design Pattern

---------------------------------
Description
---------------------------------
The Facade Design pattern uses an object that serves an simple interface to more
complex underlying code. The Facade Design pattern is often used to improve the
usability and readability of software and/or provide an interface with more generic
functionality.

---------------------------------
Provided Application
---------------------------------
Here we provide an application in "Facade.py" that gets the current time.
The application is unnecessarily complicated, as there are separate classes to
get each time measurement (hour, min, sec) however, the Facade class provides
a simple "get_time" function to consolidate this behavior. "main.py" tests
the functionality of the facade class.

---------------------------------
Filling Out the Incomplete Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there are two python3 files. "Facade.py" contains
skeletons for each class that gets a unit of time, along with the Facade class that
consolidates the units. There are comments detailing where to place code.

---------------------------------
Checking Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there is another python3 file, "main.py".
"main.py" runs a simple test of the facade get_time function.

Alternatively, the "complete" directory contains the functional
versions of each file, and an identical "main.py" file.
