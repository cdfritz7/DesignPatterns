Factory Method Design Pattern

---------------------------------
Description
---------------------------------
The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational pattern that uses class methods
to create objects without having to specify the exact class of the object being
created. These objects are created using a 'factory method' instead of using a
constructor. These factory methods are specified in an interface or in a abstract
class, then implemented or overridden in child classes.

The factory method serves to decouple the creation of objects from the objects
being created. This approach has multiple benefits such as :
1) Construction of classes with components that have not been predetermined
2) Reduction of coupling, the code interacts with the interface or abstract class
containing the factory method and is not necessarily concerned about the details
3) Allowing child classes to choose what type of objects to create
4) More readable code -> multiple constructors can be replaced with different
factory methods that have more informative names

---------------------------------
Provided Application
---------------------------------
The provided application uses the Factory Method design pattern to create two
different types of 'stores'. A 'music store' and the 'video store', which create
'music products' and 'video products' respectively. The MusicStore and VideoStore
classes are our concrete creator classes that inherit from the Store class.
These contain the factory methods that create the VideoProduct and MusicProduct
objects. This separation allows us to decouple the 'Store' from the 'Product',
if we wanted to, we could easily change the logic of the products, without
changing any store logic - and vice versa. The Store class contains functionality
such as adding, deleting, and displaying inventory, which is tested in main.py

Filling Out the Incomplete Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there are seven python3 files. Each (besides main.py)
contains comments providing small explanations about what to
do to complete each portion of the Factory Method Design pattern implementation.

---------------------------------
Checking Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there is a python3 file, "main.py".
"main.py" runs a simple test of our Factory Method Design pattern implementation.

Alternatively, the "complete" directory contains the functional implementation,
and an identical "main.py" file.
