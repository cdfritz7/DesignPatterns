Adapter Design Patter

---------------------------------
Description
---------------------------------
The Adapter Design Pattern (sometimes the wrapper design pattern) is used to present
the interface of an existing class as a different interface. It is often used
to make existing classes work together without having to change their source code.

---------------------------------
Provided Application
---------------------------------
In this example, the Adaptee class has a simple interface to store information
about a person. However, main.py needs the interface to have getter and setter
methods for each attribute. To remedy this disparaty, the Adapter class serves
as a wrapper for the Adaptee class, and provides these getters and setters.

---------------------------------
Filling Out the Incomplete Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there are three .java files. "Adaptee.java" holds the
class that has an incompatible interface, and is left completed in the "empty" directory.
"Adapter.java" holds the adapter class and should provide getters and setters for
each attribute of the Adaptee class. "main.java" runs tests using the interface
provided by the Adapter class.

---------------------------------
Checking Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there is a .java file, "main.java".
"main.java" runs a series of tests for the Adapter Design Pattern implementation.
To compile and run "main.java", use the following commands in the "empty" directory

$javac main.java
$java main

Alternatively, the "complete" directory contains the functional
versions of each file, and an identical "main.java" file.
