Abstract Factory Design Pattern

---------------------------------
Description
---------------------------------
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to
encapsulate a group of individual factories with a common theme. Generally,
a single abstract factory is extended by multiple concrete factories. These
factories share an interface provided by the abstract factory. The client
instantiates one or more of these concrete factories, and their common interface,
to create objects that are part of the theme.

This pattern is used to separate the creation of objects from their usage, and
to create families of common objects. This allows the client to exchange
concrete factories without changing the code that uses them, even at runtime.

Overall, the Abstract Factory serves to separate the creation of objects from
the client, and to provide a general interface for creating related objects.

---------------------------------
Provided Application
---------------------------------
The provided application creates four types of documents - Modern Resumes,
Modern Letters, Legal Resumes, and Legal Letters. The Abstract DocumentFactory
class is extended by the LegalDocumentFactory and ModernDocumentFactory classes.
These concrete factory classes return LegalResume, LegalLetter, ModernResume,
and ModernLetter objects. These objects extend the abstract Letter and Resume
classes.

---------------------------------
Filling Out the Incomplete Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there are ten .java files. Each (besides main.java)
contains comments providing small explanations about what to
do to complete each portion of the Abstract Factory implementation.

The classes in LegalDocumentFactory.java and ModernDocumentFactory.java both extend
the class in DocumentFactory.java

The LegalResume and ModernResume classes extend the abstract Resume class while
the LegalLetter and ModernLetter classes extend the abstract Letter class

---------------------------------
Checking Solution
---------------------------------
In the "empty" directory there is a "main.java".
"main.java" runs a simple test of the Abstract Factory implementation.
Use the following commands to compile and run the tests within the "empty" directory.

$javac main.java
$java main

Alternatively, the "complete" directory contains the completed Abstract Factory
implementation.
